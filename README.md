## Overview

This is a design of an age calculator to give the current age, days and number of months of an individaul or event using past event date.

It is a challenge on my current frontend mentor series.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My process

Firstly, i had to understand what is required of the project by reading through every instruction and viewing attached screenshots.

I Had to check for each state what is required of the calculator to do when a user meets or fails to meet each requirement.

I started with the desktop design first and trying to layout every part of the desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
  <!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library -->
  <!-- - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework -->
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learnt something from the js aspect of this challenge on how to get previous dates and trying to use it to get a current value and also putting my Js thinking hat and working through the logic of this design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I would also like to continue working on this design to give the next birthday date of the user in terms of (number of days ahead and months).

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for the logic behind getting the date and how to go about the user age calculation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
